"Von Neumann architecture","Traditional computer architecture that forms the basis of most digital computer systems. Instructions are fetched, decoded and executed one at a time."
"RAM (main memory)","Volatile (data lost when power is off) Read and write. Purpose: temporary store of currently executing instructions and their data – e.g., applications and the operating system in use."
"CPU","The main part of the computer, consisting of the registers, ALU and control unit."
"Control unit","Decodes instructions. Sends signals to control how data moves around the CPU."
"ALU","Arithmetic Logic Unit: Performs calculations e.g., x = 2 + 3 and logical comparisons – e.g., IF x > 3 in the CPU."
"Register","Tiny, purpose-built areas of high-speed memory located in the CPU. Stores data or control information temporarily – e.g., MAR, MDR, etc."
"Clock","Measured in hertz, the clock speed is the frequency at which the internal clock generates pulses. The higher the clock rate, the faster the computer may work. The ‘clock’ is the electronic unit that synchronises related components by generating pulses at a constant rate."
"Address bus","The part of the bus which carries identification about where the data is being sent e.g. the address of a memory location to read/write to/from."
"Data bus","The part of the bus that carries data between components."
"Control bus","This bus carries command and control signals to and from every other component of a computer."
"Fetch-decode-execute cycle","The complete process of retrieving an instruction from store, decoding it and carrying it out. Also known as the instruction cycle."
