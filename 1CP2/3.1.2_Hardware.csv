"Secondary storage","Permanent storage of instructions and data not in use by the processor. Stores the operating system, applications and data not in use. Read/write and non-volatile."
"Magnetic storage","Hard disk drive. Use: operating system and applications. High capacity. Medium data access speed. Low portability (except for portable drives). Reliable, but not durable. Average cost."
"Hard disk drive (HDD)","A magnetic storage device with spinning platters coated in magnetic material. Stores large amounts of data at relatively low cost but has moving parts making it slower and less durable than SSDs."
"Optical storage","CD/R, CD/RW, DVD/R, DVD/RW. Use: music, films and archive files. Low capacity. Slow access speed. High portability. Prone to scratches. Low cost."
"CD/DVD/Blu-ray","Optical discs that use lasers to read and write data. Typically used for music, films, software distribution, and backups. Capacities range from ~700 MB (CD) to 25-100 GB (Blu-ray)."
"Solid-state storage","Memory cards and solid-state hard drive (SSD). Use: digital cameras and smartphones. Medium capacity. High portability. Reliable and durable. No moving parts. Fast data access speed. High cost."
"Solid-state drive (SSD)","A high-speed storage device using flash memory. Faster and more durable than HDDs due to lack of moving parts, but usually more expensive per GB."
"USB flash drive","Portable solid-state storage device connected via USB. Typically used for file transfer and backup. Compact, durable, and relatively low capacity compared to SSDs."
"Memory card (SD card)","Small solid-state storage device often used in cameras, smartphones, and other portable devices. Reliable, lightweight, and removable."
