"Embedded system","A computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints."
"Sensor","A device that detects or measures physical properties such as temperature, light, motion, or pressure, and provides input to the embedded system."
"Actuator","A component that converts electronic signals from the embedded system into physical action, such as turning a motor or moving a valve."
"Low power consumption","Embedded systems are designed to operate using minimal energy, which is crucial for battery-powered or always-on devices."
"Real-time operation","Many embedded systems must process inputs and deliver outputs within strict timing constraints to function correctly."
"Reliability","Embedded systems are designed to run continuously and consistently, often in critical applications where failure is unacceptable."
"Dedicated functionality","An embedded system is built for a specific task rather than general-purpose computing."
"Compact size","Embedded systems are usually small and lightweight to fit into the devices they control."
"Non-volatile memory","Used to store the program instructions so the system retains functionality when powered off."
"Firmware","Software programmed into non-volatile memory that provides low-level control for the device's specific hardware."
