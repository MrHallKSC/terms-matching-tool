"Low-level language","A programming language that is closely related to machine code. Provides little abstraction from the computer's instruction set architecture."
"High-level language","A programming language that is closer to human language, allowing programs to be written in a way that is easier to read and understand, and further from machine code."
"Interpreter","A program that translates and executes source code one instruction at a time without producing a separate machine code file."
"Compiler","A program that translates the entire source code of a high-level language into machine code before execution."
"Translator","A general term for any program that converts source code into machine code, including compilers, interpreters, and assemblers."
"Machine code","The lowest-level programming language, consisting of binary instructions that can be executed directly by the CPU."
"Assembly language","A low-level programming language that uses mnemonic codes and labels to represent machine-level instructions."
"Source code","The original code written in a high-level or assembly language before it is translated into machine code."
"Object code","The output from a compiler or assembler that is in machine-readable format but not yet fully linked into an executable program."
"Executable file","A binary file that can be directly run by the operating system after compilation and linking."
"Syntax","The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured statements in a programming language."
"Semantics","The meaning of the statements and expressions in a programming language, as opposed to their structure."
