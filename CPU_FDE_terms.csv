Computer Science,CPU FDE
Key Term,Definition
Fetch‑Decode‑Execute Cycle,"The cycle by which the CPU fetches an instruction from memory, decodes it, then executes it, repeating continuously"
Fetch,The stage in the FDE cycle in which the CPU retrieves the next instruction from main memory
Decode,The stage in the FDE cycle in which the CPU interprets the fetched instruction and determines required actions
Execute,"The stage in the FDE cycle in which the CPU carries out the instruction (e.g. perform arithmetic, read/write memory)"
CPU (Central Processing Unit),The hardware component that executes instructions and processes data
ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit),The part of the CPU that performs arithmetic and logical operations
Control Unit (CU),"The part of the CPU that directs and controls the operations of the CPU, including decoding instructions and orchestrating data movement"
Register,"Small, very fast storage locations within the CPU used to hold data and instructions during execution"
Program Counter (PC),A register that holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched
Memory Address Register (MAR),A register that stores the address in memory to which the CPU wants to read or write
Memory Data Register (MDR),A register that holds the data value read from or to be written into memory
Current Instruction Register (CIR) / Instruction Register (IR),A register that holds the instruction currently being decoded/executed
Clock,An electronic component that produces a regular signal (pulse) to synchronise operations inside the CPU
Clock Speed,"The frequency at which the CPU clock ticks (often measured in hertz), determining how many FDE cycles per second"
Bus,"Electrical pathways that transfer data, addresses or control signals between CPU, memory and peripherals"
Address Bus,The bus that carries memory addresses from the CPU to memory
Data Bus,"The bus that carries actual data between CPU, memory and peripherals"
Control Bus,"The bus that carries control signals (for example read/write, interrupt) between CPU and other components"
Von Neumann Architecture,An architecture in which program instructions and data share the same memory and paths (buses)
Cache,Very fast temporary memory located close to the CPU used to reduce time to access frequently used data
Interrupt,"A signal to the CPU indicating that an external event needs immediate attention, pausing the normal FDE cycle"
Embedded System,A computer system built into a larger device to control its operations
Secondary Storage,"Non‑volatile storage (e.g. hard disk, SSD) used to store data and programs when power is off"
