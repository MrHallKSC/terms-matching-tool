3.1.1,Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle
Fetch‑Decode‑Execute Cycle,"The cycle by which the CPU fetches an instruction from memory, decodes it, then executes it, repeating continuously"
CPU (Central Processing Unit),"The hardware component that executes instructions and processes data"
ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit),"The part of the CPU that performs arithmetic and logical operations"
Control Unit (CU),"The part of the CPU that directs and controls the operations of the CPU, including decoding instructions and orchestrating data movement"
Register,"Small very fast storage locations within the CPU used to hold data and instructions during execution"
Program Counter (PC),"A register that holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched"
Memory Address Register (MAR),"A register that stores the address in memory to which the CPU wants to read or write"
Memory Data Register (MDR),"A register that holds the data value read from or to be written into memory"
Current Instruction Register (CIR),"A register that holds the instruction currently being decoded/executed"
Address Bus,"The bus that carries memory addresses from the CPU to memory"
Data Bus,"The bus that carries actual data between CPU, memory and peripherals"
Control Bus,"The bus that carries control signals (for example read/write, interrupt) between CPU and other components"
